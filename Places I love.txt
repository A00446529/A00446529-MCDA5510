Pokhara
Rara

Two places I loved to visit!

I love Pokhara because of the lakes and the mountains out there. Also, I love the fact that there are so many resturants that serve delicious food.

Rara, in the other hand, is located in very remote part of Nepal. I love the natural beauty there and the people that reside there.
